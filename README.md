🏗️ Analytics Engineering

The Art of Data Modeling for Real-World Analytics & ML

This repository showcases a collection of Analytics Engineering projects.

In real companies, data is rarely clean, structured, or directly usable.
Kaggle datasets are not real life.

Analytics Engineering bridges the gap between:
	•	raw, messy operational data
	•	reliable analytics
	•	production-ready Machine Learning

Well-designed data models are the foundation of:
	•	trustworthy dashboards
	•	consistent business metrics
	•	efficient and scalable ML pipelines

This is exactly where dbt plays a central role.

🧱 Why Analytics Engineering matters

In production environments:
	•	data comes from multiple sources
	•	schemas change
	•	business rules evolve
	•	data quality issues are common

Analytics Engineering focuses on:
	•	transforming raw data into clean, tested, and documented models
	•	enforcing business logic once, in the data layer
	•	enabling downstream use cases: analytics, monitoring, and ML

🪪 Use Case — Document Fraud Detection at Subscription

Context

Subscription fraud is often the first step in more complex fraud scenarios.

Fraudsters create accounts using:
	•	fake or reused identity documents
	•	inconsistent personal information
	•	suspicious behavioral patterns

Detecting fraud early at signup significantly reduces downstream risk.

What this project does

This project models subscription and identity document data to:

1️⃣ Analyze subscription quality
	•	document reuse
	•	identity inconsistencies
	•	abnormal subscription patterns

2️⃣ Enable fraud detection
	•	SQL-based rules
	•	feature-ready datasets for ML models

The goal is to move from:

raw subscription events
to
interpretable, decision-ready data models

⸻

Outcomes
	•	Analytics-ready tables for dashboards and investigations
	•	Consistent data models usable by:
	•	analysts
	•	data scientists
	•	fraud teams
	•	A solid foundation for:
	•	rule-based fraud detection
	•	supervised ML models
