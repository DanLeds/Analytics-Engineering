## The Art of Data Modeling for Real-World Analytics & ML

This repository showcases a collection of Analytics Engineering projects.

In real companies, data is rarely clean, structured, or directly usable.
Kaggle datasets are not real life.

Analytics Engineering bridges the gap between:
- raw, messy operational data
- reliable analytics
- production-ready Machine Learning

Well-designed data models are the foundation of:
	- trustworthy dashboards
	- consistent business metrics
	- efficient and scalable ML pipelines

This is exactly where dbt plays a central role.

## 🧱 Why Analytics Engineering matters

In production environments:
	- data comes from multiple sources
	- schemas change
	- business rules evolve
	- data quality issues are common

Analytics Engineering focuses on:
	- transforming raw data into clean, tested, and documented models
	- enforcing business logic once, in the data layer
	- enabling downstream use cases: analytics, monitoring, and ML

## 🪪 Use Case — Document Fraud Detection at Subscription

Context

Subscription fraud is often the first step in more complex fraud scenarios.

Fraudsters create accounts using:
	- fake or reused identity documents
	- inconsistent personal information
	- suspicious behavioral patterns

Detecting fraud early at signup significantly reduces downstream risk.

What this project does

This project models subscription and identity document data to:

1️⃣ Analyze subscription quality
	- document reuse
	- identity inconsistencies
	- abnormal subscription patterns

2️⃣ Enable fraud detection
	- SQL-based rules
	- feature-ready datasets for ML models

The goal is to move from:

raw subscription events
to
interpretable, decision-ready data models

⸻

Outcomes
	- Analytics-ready tables for dashboards and investigations
	- Consistent data models usable by:
	- analysts
	- data scientists
	- fraud teams

A solid foundation for:
	- rule-based fraud detection
	- supervised ML models
