# 🏗️ Analytics Engineering Or the Art of Modelling 🗃️

This GitHub repository showcases a collection of my Analytics Engineering projects, because models tables for cleaned and structured data are the foundation of Data Science and Machine Learning.
Indeed, Kaggle is not the real life. In companies, data are dirty, not structured and not interpretable in ist current state. That's why DBT exists to help you to model tables for reliable analysis and for efficient training of Machine Learning models.

## 🪪 Document Fraud: Assessing documents identities at susbcription

Subscription fraud is the first step of Fraud Committed. Fraudster suscribes at a platform app in the order to commit more serious and significant fraud. 
Firstly, models tables created allow to analyze in query mode or dashboard mode the state of subscriptions with documents ids.
Secondly, these models allow to model Machine Learning algorithms or SQL based-rules in the order to detect and prevent fraud.
